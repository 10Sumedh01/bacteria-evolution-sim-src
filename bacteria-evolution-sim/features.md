# Bacteria Evolution Simulation - Features and Parameters

## Bacteria Properties
- **Size**: Affects energy consumption and reproduction rate
- **Speed**: Affects ability to find food and avoid threats
- **Metabolism**: Rate at which bacteria consume energy
- **Resistance**: Ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions
- **Lifespan**: Maximum number of simulation cycles a bacterium can live
- **Mutation Rate**: Probability of mutation during reproduction

## Environmental Conditions (Adjustable Parameters)
- **Temperature**: Affects metabolism and energy consumption
- **pH Level**: Affects reproduction rate and survival
- **Nutrient Availability**: Affects growth and reproduction
- **Toxicity**: Introduces selective pressure
- **Antibiotics**: Creates strong selective pressure for resistance
- **Carrying Capacity**: Maximum population the environment can support

## Evolution Mechanics
- **Reproduction**: Asexual reproduction with possibility of mutations
- **Natural Selection**: Bacteria with traits better suited to the environment survive longer
- **Mutation**: Random changes to bacteria properties during reproduction
- **Adaptation**: Over time, the population should adapt to the environmental conditions
- **Competition**: Bacteria compete for limited resources

## Visualization
- **Color Coding**: Represent different bacteria properties
- **Size Representation**: Visual indication of bacteria size
- **Movement**: Animated movement based on bacteria speed
- **Population Graph**: Track population size over time
- **Trait Distribution**: Show distribution of traits in the population

## User Controls
- **Start/Pause**: Control simulation execution
- **Reset**: Reset the simulation to initial state
- **Speed Control**: Adjust simulation speed
- **Parameter Sliders**: Adjust environmental conditions
- **Mutation Controls**: Adjust mutation rate and impact
- **Preset Scenarios**: Predefined environmental conditions

## Statistics and Analysis
- **Population Size**: Track total number of bacteria
- **Average Traits**: Show average values for each trait
- **Generation Counter**: Track number of generations
- **Extinction Events**: Record when population drops significantly
- **Dominant Traits**: Identify which traits become dominant over time
